## Projects
### Web Development
- [Dither & Etch](ditherandetch.ca): A locally owned and operated laser engraver specializing in art, decor, and commissioned pieces.


### IoT Projects
- An interactive [button board](https://github.com/jarettrude/buttonboard) that I made for my kids that ran off a raspberry pi. I found [lightshowpi](https://www.reddit.com/r/LightShowPi/wiki/index/) that was designed to make christmas lights dance to music. By studying the code and following other people's implementations, I hacked together my own program written in python that allowed me to loop through my own sound files each time different buttons were pressed.
- A [photobooth](https://github.com/jarettrude/photobooth) that I made using a raspberrypi, touchscreen, arduino, LEDs, and an old computer power supply. The photobooth allowed you to connect any digital camera that was supported by the [gphoto2](http://www.gphoto.org) to the raspberry pi and take photos through a locally hosted web app. My fork was primarily to customize the look of the webapp to meet my needs.
- A raspberry pi camera project, [PiCameraBox](https://github.com/jarettrude/PiCameraBox), written in python to control a camera module so that I could take pictures, record time-lapses, or capture video inside my laser engraver.
